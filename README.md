**🏥 Hospital Analytics Dashboard | Power BI**

🔍 **Overview**
An end-to-end Hospital Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI, designed to help hospital management make data-driven decisions by consolidating operational, financial, and patient-related data into a single analytical view.
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data modeling, DAX, and business-oriented analytics.

🎯 **Business Problem**
Hospitals generate data across multiple departments such as patients, billing, doctors, pharmacy, and infrastructure.
However, this data is often scattered, making it difficult for leadership to:
- Track performance in real time
- Identify operational bottlenecks
- Monitor revenue and profitability
- Measure service quality
This project solves that problem by providing a centralized, interactive analytics solution.

🧠 Solution Approach
- Designed a scalable star-schema data model
- Built custom DAX measures aligned with business logic
- Created interactive dashboards focused on decision-making
- Enabled time-based analysis using a Calendar table

📊 Dashboard Coverage
The Power BI report is divided into 6 business-focused pages:
1. **Home** – Executive snapshot and navigation
2. **Overview** – Overall hospital KPIs
3. **Patient Analytics** – Admissions, discharges, demographics, trends
4. **Doctor Analytics** – Availability, salary, commissions, ratings
5. **Hospital Operations** – Beds, rooms, occupancy utilization
6. **Finance & Pharmacy** – Billing, payments, medicine sales, profit

🧩 Data Modeling

**Fact Tables:**
– Appointments
– Hospital Bills
– Medicine Sales
– Patient Tests

**Dimension Tables:**
– Patient
– Doctor
– Department
– Medical Stock
– Calendar

Why Star Schema?
– Better performance
– Simpler DAX calculations
– Scalable design

🧮 **Key DAX & Business Logic**
– Admissions vs discharges tracking
– Revenue by payment method
– Doctor commission calculation
– Bed availability and occupancy
– Pharmacy sales quantity and profit
– Patient satisfaction ratings
All calculations were designed with clear operational or financial intent, not just reporting.

🛠 **Tech Stack**
– Power BI
– DAX
– Power Query
– Data Modeling (Star Schema)

📈 **Key Learnings**
– Clean data modeling is critical for analytics scalability
– DAX should always follow business logic
– Dashboards must prioritize clarity for decision-makers
– Healthcare analytics requires accuracy and usability
