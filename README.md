🏥 Hospital Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

🔍 Overview
An end-to-end Hospital Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI, designed to help hospital management make data-driven decisions by consolidating operational, financial, and patient-related data into a single analytical view.
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data modeling, DAX, and business-oriented analytics.

🎯 Business Problem
Hospitals generate data across multiple departments such as patients, billing, doctors, pharmacy, and infrastructure.
However, this data is often scattered, making it difficult for leadership to:
Track performance in real time
Identify operational bottlenecks
Monitor revenue and profitability
Measure service quality

This project solves that problem by providing a centralized, interactive analytics solution.

🧠 Solution Approach
Designed a scalable star-schema data model
Built custom DAX measures aligned with business logic
Created interactive dashboards focused on decision-making
Enabled time-based analysis using a Calendar table

📊 Dashboard Coverage
The Power BI report is divided into 6 business-focused pages:
Home – Executive snapshot and navigation
Overview – Overall hospital KPIs
Patient Analytics – Admissions, discharges, demographics, trends
Doctor Analytics – Availability, salary, commissions, ratings
Hospital Operations – Beds, rooms, occupancy utilization
Finance & Pharmacy – Billing, payments, medicine sales, profit

🧩 Data Modeling

Fact Tables:
Appointments
Hospital Bills
Medicine Sales
Patient Tests

Dimension Tables:
Patient
Doctor
Department
Medical Stock
Calendar

Why Star Schema?
Better performance
Simpler DAX calculations
Scalable design

🧮 Key DAX & Business Logic
Admissions vs discharges tracking
Revenue by payment method
Doctor commission calculation
Bed availability and occupancy
Pharmacy sales quantity and profit
Patient satisfaction ratings
All calculations were designed with clear operational or financial intent, not just reporting.
